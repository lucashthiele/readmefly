To ensure consistency and maintainability, please follow these guidelines:

- **Code Style**: Follow [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules (if applicable).
- **Variable Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names in English. Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely accepted.
